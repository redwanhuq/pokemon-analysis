# Exploring the Pokemon dataset with pandas and seaborn
The Pokemon dataset is a complete listing of all Pokemon species as of mid-2016, containing data about their type and statistics. Considering how diverse Pokemon are, it's worthwhile analyzing this datset to identify any insights regarding the design of new Pokemon, how the game is balanced and to potentially assist players in selecting the best Pokemon, if there exists one. And having been a fervent Pokemon fan as a kid, I'm also dreadfully curious!

While one could easily analyze the dataset using Excel, this software isn't very handy for cleaning messy datasets or telling a story. In addition, Excel is proprietary/closed, not capable of processing large data sets (limited to 1,048,576 rows), and its analyses lack repeatability and transparency. One solution is to use [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) for exploratory analysis combined with Python's open-source libraries: [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) for data analysis and [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) for high-level visualizations.

The fully documented analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook in this repo. The Pokemon dataset was made available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) and can also be found in this repo. If you have any suggestions, comments or questions on the analysis, please visit the [blog post](http://machinemadephd.com/posts/exploring-pokemon-dataset).
